	<p>
		One of the biggest challenges I face with software development is remembering implementations I
		have previously done. Unfortunately, the brain works on a 'use it or lose it' basis; often I do
		certain programming tasks only once every few months. I often take notes on concepts I know I
		will not cover for a while, but it's usually not enough.
	</p>

	<p>
		The idea of this project is to implement different things using svelte and sveltekit that I've
		touched on at work or in personal projects, creating a pratical wiki of implemetations. Each
		project or implementation will have it's own tab found on the navbar and below with some
		additional information as necessary. It will serve as a place for me to jog my memory and give
		myself some working examples on things that are but a vague mirage.
